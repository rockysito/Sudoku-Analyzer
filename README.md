2. Select difficulty: `Easy`, `Medium`, `Hard`, or `Expert`
3. Click **Generate!** — a random valid puzzle appears instantly

---

### Timer (Manual Solving)

1. Enter or generate a puzzle
2. Click **▶ Start Timer** to begin counting
3. Solve it yourself by typing values
4. Click **⏹ Stop Timer** when done

---

### Import a Puzzle from File

Supported file formats:

**Format A — 9 lines of 9 digits (`.` or `0` for unknowns):**
```
530070000

## 🧠 Solver Techniques Explained

| Technique | Description | Difficulty |
|---|---|---|
| **Naked Single** | A cell has only one valid candidate | Easy |
| **Hidden Single** | A candidate exists in only one cell of a row/column/box | Easy–Medium |
| **Pointing Pairs** | A candidate in a box is restricted to one row/column; eliminate it elsewhere | Medium |
| **Backtracking** | Brute-force with MRV (Minimum Remaining Values) heuristic | Hard/Expert |

The solver applies techniques in order of complexity and only falls back to backtracking when logic fails.

## 🧪 Testing the Solver (Command Line)

You can run the solver without the GUI for quick testing:

```python
from sudoku_analyzer import SudokuAnalyzer

board = [
    [5,3,0,0,7,0,0,0,0],
    [6,0,0,1,9,5,0,0,0],
    [0,9,8,0,0,0,0,6,0],
    [8,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,3],
    [4,0,0,8,0,3,0,0,1],
    [7,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6],
    [0,6,0,0,0,0,2,8,0],
    [0,0,0,4,1,9,0,0,5],
    [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,7,9],
]

analyzer = SudokuAnalyzer(board)
solution = analyzer.solve()

for row in solution:
    print(row)

print("\nTechniques used:")
for k, v in analyzer.techniques_used.items():
    print(f"  {k}: {v}")

print(f"\nDifficulty: {analyzer.rate_difficulty()}")
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: "Puzzle tidak bisa diselesaikan" appears even though my puzzle looks correct.**  
A: Check for duplicate numbers in the same row, column, or 3×3 box. The validator will catch conflicts.

**Q: The app is slow on Expert puzzles.**  
A: Expert puzzles (17–19 givens) require heavy backtracking. Generation may take 5–30 seconds — this is normal.

**Q: Can I add my own puzzles?**  
A: Yes! Save any 9×9 puzzle as `.txt` (dots for empty cells) and use **📂 Load from File**.
